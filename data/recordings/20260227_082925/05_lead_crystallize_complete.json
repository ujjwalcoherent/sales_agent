These firms, including LetsVenture, ClearTax, and LawRato, cater to startups with enhanced services like mentorship, legal support, and financial tools, necessary as VCs differentiate themselves beyond capital. Increased competition compels providers to scale and innovate, presenting another opportunity.\n\nThe third-order impact (Hop 3) extends to vendors and technology suppliers who support these service providers and the startups they serve.

Companies performing these acquisitions often rely on legal, financial, due diligence SMEs which will face reduced business due to fewer deals (Hop 2). These advisory SMEs in turn influence investment firms and banks that fund acquisitions; the reduced pipeline and increased risks will constrain their investment activities (Hop 3).
