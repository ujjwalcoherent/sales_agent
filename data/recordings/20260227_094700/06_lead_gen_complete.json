Simultaneously, NSE's Global Access platform launched enabling Indian investors to access over 30 global markets and accelerate outbound investments, adding to volatility in Indian IT stocks.\n\nFirst order impact involves direct volatility and capital outflow from large Indian IT stocks such as Infosys and TCS, facing valuation pressure and investor portfolio shocks.\n\nSecond order impact concerns mid-size Indian IT companies (100-1000 employees) that supply services or contract with these large IT firms. These mid-size companies face revenue and operational uncertainties due to reduced contract commitments and spending adjustments by large IT firms trying to manage capital outflows and volatility.\n\nThird order impact includes IT staffing and outsourcing SMEs (50-500 employees) that service mid-size IT firms, potentially facing delayed contract slowdowns and hiring freezes due to mid-size firms' revenue pressures. There might also be a secondary effect on small product development firms serving mid-size IT services providers.\n\nUrgency: Hop 1 immediate (0-2 weeks), Hop 2 medium term (2-6 weeks) as contracts adjust, Hop 3 longer term (4-12 weeks) with staffing and smaller vendor impacts manifesting.",
