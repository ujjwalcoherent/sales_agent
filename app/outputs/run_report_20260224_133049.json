The company's move is seen as a response to the tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, including Iran and Canada. The development may have significant implications for companies involved in international trade. The US government's actions have been met with criticism from various quarters, with some arguing that the tariffs are not an effective way to address trade imbalances. The situation remains fluid, with the US government yet to respond to the court's decision.",
