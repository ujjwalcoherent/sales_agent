      "summary": "The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has revised its refund norms, allowing passengers to cancel or change air tickets without extra charges within 48 hours of booking, subject to certain conditions. The DGCA also mandated that airlines cannot charge extra for name corrections made within 24 hours of booking directly through their website. Airlines must complete refunds within 14 working days, even for travel agent bookings. These changes aim to provide more flexibility and protection to passengers.\n\nThe new regulations address issues such as name corrections and medical emergencies, offering passengers greater control over their bookings. This shift in policy impacts airlines, travel agents, and passengers, requiring airlines to adapt their systems and processes to comply with the revised norms. The DGCA's move is expected to increase passenger satisfaction and potentially boost direct bookings with airlines.\n\nLooking ahead, airlines will need to ensure compliance with the new refund norms and adjust their pricing strategies accordingly. Travel agents may also need to update their booking systems to reflect these changes. The impact on airline profitability and operational efficiency will be closely monitored in the coming months.",
